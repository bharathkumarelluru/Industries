🎨 Day 6 – Introduction to CSS (World’s Top Companies Project)
This project is part of my Frontend Development Learning Journey.
On Day 6, I learned about the introduction of CSS, including:

Basic CSS properties
Different types of selectors (element, class, ID)
Applying styles to make content visually appealing

📌 Project Overview
The project lists the World’s Top Companies by Industry with:
🏢 Technology Companies
🚗 Automobile Companies
🛒 E-Commerce Companies
Each section highlights the top company using ID selectors, while section titles are styled with class selectors.

🏗️ Features Implemented
Custom styling for headings (<h1> and <h2>)
Class selectors (.category) to style category titles
ID selectors (#top-tech, #top-auto, #top-ecom) to highlight top companies
Use of colors, font styles, spacing, and backgrounds

📂 Files in the Project
index.html → Structure of the webpage
style.css → CSS styling for headings, sections, and highlights

💡 What I Learned
Linking CSS with HTML using <link>
Styling elements with CSS properties (font, color, background, margin, etc.)
Using class selectors for reusable styles
Using ID selectors for unique styles
Organizing code cleanly by separating structure (HTML) and style (CSS)
